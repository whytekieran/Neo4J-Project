## **_Introduction_**
My name is Ciaran Whyte and as part of a Graph Thoery Module based in GMIT (Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology) i have to design and build a
graph database. I will be creating the database using Neo4J. 

So what is Neo4J and what is a graph database? To explain what these are we can compare them to the more commonly used relational database. 
Neo4J is the worlds leading graph database managment system, developed by Neo Technology Inc.

## **_Database_**
Explain how you created your database, and how information is represented in it.

## Queries
Summarise your three queries here.
Then explain them one by one in the following sections.

#### Query one title
This query retreives the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```

#### Query two title
This query retreives the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```

#### Query three title
This query retreives the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```
