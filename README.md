## **_Introduction_**
My name is Ciaran Whyte and as part of a Graph Thoery Module based in GMIT (Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology) i have to design and build a
graph database. I will be creating the database in Neo4J which uses a query language called Cypher. This is the equivalant of a language like SQL used
with relational databases.

## **_Database_**
Explain how you created your database, and how information is represented in it.

## Queries
Summarise your three queries here.
Then explain them one by one in the following sections.

#### Query one title
This query retreives the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```

#### Query two title
This query retreives the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```

#### Query three title
This query retreives the Bacon number of an actor...
```cypher
MATCH
	(Bacon)
RETURN
	Bacon;
```
